Aubrey

*started from key-value now we here*

Named after [Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_%28rapper%29), Aubrey turns a key-value store into a full-fledged collection that you can query, iterate over, and more. In theory, it should work with in-memory objects, Redis, localStorage, or whatever...but it's not done yet.
